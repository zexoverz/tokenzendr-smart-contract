## Overview

In this tutorial you would be building a smart contract for transfering an ERC20 token to any ERC20 compliant wallet including metamask and exchange addresses. The method shown in this tutorial is a simplified version of what decentralised exchanges such as forkdelta uses.


## What Will I Learn?
You would be learning how to write and test a smart contract that can trasfer tokens from your wallet to other ERC20 compatible addresses.

- How decentralised exchanges deposit and withdrawl feature mechanism works
- How to write a smart contract in solidity to transfer ERC20 tokens
- Testing your smart contract and Interacting with it through the truffle console

## Setup

```js
git clone https://github.com/zexoverz/tokenzendr-smart-contract/

cd tokenzendr-contract

npm install

truffle console

truffle(development)> compile

truffle(development)> migrate --reset
